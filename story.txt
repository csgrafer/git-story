snow this is a story all about how
my life got flipped turned upside down
and I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
I'll tell you how I become the prince of a town called Bel Air

in west Philadelphia born and raised
on the playground is where I spent most of my days
chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
and all shootin' some b ball outside of the school
when a couple of guys who were up to no good
started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mon scared
and said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
and I yelled to the cabbie yo homes smell ya later
looked at my kingdom I was finally there
to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air

The End
